## Professionally

I'm currently working on building infosec related webapps for MindPoint Group. Our team is currently small but we plan to start growing and are looking for solid engineers who want a piece of the action. At a high-level, we're hard at work in order to make security best-practices and easy thing to implement across an IT estate.

In the dev process we use AWS, Heroku, CircleCI, Meteor Galaxy and Mongo's Atlas. We're comfortable tinkering with the bleeding edge and we're also pretty big proponents of being part of open source communities. Imagine having all the dynamism of a startup including scope of impact, minus the whole funding problem.

So if you think working along side me would be cool my team needs help in the web app dev department. We use JavaScript (nodejs) and Python (django) but we don't care if you've only ever worked in Rails or <insert other web stack here>. As long as you have a good grasp of web dev concepts I'm interested in chatting with you.
