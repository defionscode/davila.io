I'm thrilled that you might be interested in working with me.

I care deeply about giving back to open-source, workplace diversity, and helping others achieve their goals. I cannot work or contract with an organization that is at odds with these things. 

**Important:** If you are against contributing back your changes to open source work you leverage, if you think current diversity in tech is 'not bad', or if you see your people as expendable, then please, do not try to work with me.

Currently, I'm not actively seeking full-time work. However, I'm open to contract work on a part time or ad hoc basis.

If you'd like to reach out regarding this type of work, hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davilaio/).
