## [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) [M/O]
Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applicationsâ€” automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems. My contributions are largely focused around AWS integration.

## [Ansible Lockdown](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lockdown) [M/C/O]
Ansible Lockdown is an open source project that aims to make the application of security baselines easier to apply to an IT estate via Ansible. The DISA STIG and CIS Benchmarks are the current implementations.

## [SAML2 Auth for Django](https://github.com/MindPointGroup/django-saml2-pro-auth) [M/C/O]
After finding a complete lack of SAML2 authentication backends for Django, I created one under sponsorship of MindPoint Group. It's production ready and licensed under MIT terms.

## Image Management - [M/C/P] 
Currently developing a platform that aims to make it easy to manage the lifecycle of machine images across public cloud providers in such a way that promotes DevOps practices while also allowing orgs to keep their cloud estate free of stale images while keeping their baselines (ie Golden Images) in a properly patched state.

## Eloquent Ansible - [M/C/P]
Currently developing a full blown learning platform for individuals and organizations to learn how to leverage Ansible effectively. The platform is based on my experience delivering Ansible professional services across countless organizations in both public and private sector.
