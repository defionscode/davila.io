**UPDATE:** Old blog is no longer available, all the posts have been moved here.

I've Moved
-----------

This is a simple post. I've decided to use [Nikola][nikola] + [GitHub Pages][ghpages] to do my blogging instead of using WordPress.com. The reason is straightforward; the friendliness of <!-- TEASER_END -->doing technical writeups. In wordpress.com there is no support for writing posts in markdown and codeblocks are a glorious pain to use and require a constant check of the 'preview' to produce something that looks decent. In a subsequent post I'll write out how I made the transtion and few minor obstacles that came out of it. The old blog, should you desire to take a look can be ~~found here~~.

```yaml

- this: Look a code block!
```

So you see, I can add a typical markdown codeblock or even import a GitHub Gist and it is simple, straightforward and I don't have to worry about validating my posts with preview-mode refreshes.
