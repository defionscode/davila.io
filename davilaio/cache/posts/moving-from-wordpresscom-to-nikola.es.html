<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Old blog is no longer available, all the posts have been moved here.</p>
<h2>I've Moved</h2>
<p>This is a simple post. I've decided to use <a href="http://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> + <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to do my blogging instead of using WordPress.com. The reason is straightforward; the friendliness of <!-- TEASER_END -->doing technical writeups. In wordpress.com there is no support for writing posts in markdown and codeblocks are a glorious pain to use and require a constant check of the 'preview' to produce something that looks decent. In a subsequent post I'll write out how I made the transtion and few minor obstacles that came out of it. The old blog, should you desire to take a look can be ~~found here~~.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nn">---</span>

</pre>

<div class="gist">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4747847.js"></script>

<pre>import this</pre>

</div>
</p>
<p>So you see, I can add a typical markdown codeblock or even import a GitHub Gist and it is simple, straightforward and I don't have to worry about validating my posts with preview-mode refreshes.</p>
