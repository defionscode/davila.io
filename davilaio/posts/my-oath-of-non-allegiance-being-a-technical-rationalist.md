I’ve noticed an increasing trend among technologists (developers, ops, architects, etc). They adopt a specific technology <thing> or a stack of <things> at any given point in their career and they embrace it to the death. This is stupid.<!-- TEASER_END -->

To clarify, I am all for the rapid adoption of the latest and greatest, as I am in favor of thorough research and testing of a new <thing> before using it in a production setting. However, when any person holds onto a <thing> with a death grip just because, I find that highly irrational.

Equally as important is the notion that many times there are <old things> in place that are working just fine and a someone tries to barge in and replace it with the latest and greatest “shiny”, this also makes no sense. If something is working well and efficiently, there really isn’t a reason to change it unless the change would bring about significant performance, cost and or efficiency improvements.

For those that frequent the more popular tech blogs you will have already made the connection to [Alistair Cockburn’s blog][alistair-blog] where he coined the [Oath of Non-Allegiance.][oath]

> I promise not to exclude from consideration any idea based on its source, but to consider ideas across schools and heritages in order to find the ones that best suit the current situation.

> This means the end of statements like “That’s no good – it’s not agile / object-oriented / pure / etc…”, but rather a discussion about whether idea (agile or plan-driven or impure or whatever) works well in the conditions of the moment.

> When the canvas of a technical project is blank, there is every reason to look at every rational option and make an educated decision as to which would be best for the given scenario; just as important, it is key to be able and willing to pivot should a better <thing> arise.
