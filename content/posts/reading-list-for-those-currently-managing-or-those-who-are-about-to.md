This year I’ve read many books on management, some that are tech-specific and others that are more broadly focused. I present to you a short list (in no particular order) on the books I feel are the best with a brief into allowing to get a feel for whether or not the particular book is for you.

> Note: The links to the books are not affiliate links at all, this is purely for the public’s benefit.

## The Hard Thing About Hard Things

Author: Ben Horowitz
[Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205)

Right for you if…

* You are leading or about/aspire to lead the entirety of a business whether it is a startup, business unit, or entire organization

* Enjoy reading about and learning from the mistakes of others (this book has plenty of examples).

## The One Thing

Author: Gary Keller
[Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/ONE-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results-ebook/dp/B00C1BHQXK/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1502373692&sr=1-1&keywords=One+Thing)

Right for you if…

* You think multi-tasking at scale is actually a good idea

* Your business or personal to-do list is more crammed than an NFL lineman’s plate at an all you can eat buffet

* You frequently struggle with what the first step for a particular end goal should be (either personally or in business).

## High Output Management

Author: Andy S. Grove
[Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884)

Right for you if…

* You have little to no idea on how to grow and manage a large business. IOW, going from 0 to a 5 million business requires a different set of skills, priorities, and actions than going from 5 million to 100 million.

* You frequently ponder, “What the heck does a CEO do anyways?”

* Your knowledge of corporate strategy is limited to its usage as a buzzword.

* You feel comfortable distilling broad concepts into methodologies you can apply in different settings.

## The Manager’s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change

Author: Camille Fournier
[Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1502374166&sr=1-1&keywords=camille+fournier)

Right for you if…

* You aspire to be a manager of Tech folks but aren’t sure what rungs to shoot for next nor what you should be mastering at each step.

* You aren’t technical but you want to better understand how managing engineers differs from other career disciplines

* You like more detailed management guidance as opposed to broad concepts.

## Principles: Life and Work

Author: Ray Dalio
[Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio-ebook/dp/B071CTK28D/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1502374390&sr=1-1&keywords=principles+ray+dalio)
> Special Note: This is probably my personal favorite of this list. As of this post the book is on pre-order, but I was fortunate enough to get a copy of the book that is made available to all employees, contractors, and visitors to Bridgewater Associates.

Right for you if…

* You enjoy the idea of running an team or organization that sugar coats nothing and where bullshitting is actively weeded out.

* You’ve curious to understand the intimate psychology of a billionaire who started from humble beginnings.

* You are a capable of, or at least open to, self-analyzing and self-evaluating yourself as objectively as possible.

**That’s it!**

This was a simpler blog post and I hope you get *something* out of at least one of the books I’ve listed.
