      <description>This year I’ve read many books on management, some that are tech-specific and others that are more broadly focused. I present to you a short list (in no particular order) on the books I feel are the best with a brief into allowing to get a feel for whether or not the particular book is for you.
 Note: The links to the books are not affiliate links at all, this is purely for the public’s benefit.</description>
