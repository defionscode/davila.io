      <description>This might stir some controversy.
Contributions are really nice, but at scale they can be expensive. I think this dissuades some organizations from open sourcing any of their code. Recently, a thought ocurred to me, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s okay to open source something while at the same time not really caring for community.
What if we made projects that didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily care for contributions? Would companies be more willing to be transparent with their code if there wasn&amp;rsquo;t an implicit expectation of &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; support?</description>
