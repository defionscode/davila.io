      <description>Disclosure: As with all of my posts this is going to be highly opinionated and will probably bother some folks. The premises and arguments I ultimately present are solely based on my experience. I also want to make clear that I am open to being wrong and if you find fault in my logic or conclusions (maybe there are studies I’m not privy to) I hope that you bring it up either in public or privately, whatever you feel comfortable with.</description>

      <title>Attracting Top Tech Engineers</title>

      <description>I preface this article by saying I am not a recruiter nor have ever been and that &amp;lsquo;Top&amp;rsquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily implying senior in terms of time in tech. For example, I am a strong believer that there are people who have been in tech less than 5 years who are of a higher caliber than engineers who&amp;rsquo;ve been in tech for 20+ years, but of course this is not always true.</description>
