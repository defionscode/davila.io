      <description>With this post you will learn how to implement DevOps in your organization with as little as 7 minutes a day in just 3 months!

      <description>Disclaimer: This is a personal article. The opinions expressed here represent my own and not those of my employer.
 DevOps is one of the biggest trends in the IT space, especially within the cloud world; many organizations that have DevOps in place have already started to see the benefits. However, just like with Agile, Federal Agencies see the benefits, understand the &amp;lsquo;awesomeness&amp;rsquo; and want it, but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do it and most attempts have not hit the mark.</description>
