<p>This year I’ve read many books on management, some that are tech-specific and others that are more broadly focused. I present to you a short list (in no particular order) on the books I feel are the best with a brief into allowing to get a feel for whether or not the particular book is for you.</p>

<h2 id="the-hard-thing-about-hard-things">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</h2>

<p>Author: Ben Horowitz
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205">Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>Right for you if…</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You are leading or about/aspire to lead the entirety of a business whether it is a startup, business unit, or entire organization</p></li>

<li><p>Enjoy reading about and learning from the mistakes of others (this book has plenty of examples).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-one-thing">The One Thing</h2>

<p>Author: Gary Keller
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ONE-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results-ebook/dp/B00C1BHQXK/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502373692&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=One+Thing">Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>Right for you if…</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You think multi-tasking at scale is actually a good idea</p></li>

<li><p>Your business or personal to-do list is more crammed than an NFL lineman’s plate at an all you can eat buffet</p></li>

<li><p>You frequently struggle with what the first step for a particular end goal should be (either personally or in business).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="high-output-management">High Output Management</h2>

<p>Author: Andy S. Grove
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884">Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>Right for you if…</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You have little to no idea on how to grow and manage a large business. IOW, going from 0 to a 5 million business requires a different set of skills, priorities, and actions than going from 5 million to 100 million.</p></li>

<li><p>You frequently ponder, “What the heck does a CEO do anyways?”</p></li>

<li><p>Your knowledge of corporate strategy is limited to its usage as a buzzword.</p></li>

<li><p>You feel comfortable distilling broad concepts into methodologies you can apply in different settings.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-manager-s-path-a-guide-for-tech-leaders-navigating-growth-and-change">The Manager’s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change</h2>

<p>Author: Camille Fournier
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502374166&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=camille+fournier">Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>Right for you if…</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You aspire to be a manager of Tech folks but aren’t sure what rungs to shoot for next nor what you should be mastering at each step.</p></li>

<li><p>You aren’t technical but you want to better understand how managing engineers differs from other career disciplines</p></li>

<li><p>You like more detailed management guidance as opposed to broad concepts.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="principles-life-and-work">Principles: Life and Work</h2>

<p>Author: Ray Dalio
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio-ebook/dp/B071CTK28D/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502374390&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=principles+ray+dalio">Amazon Link</a>
&gt; Special Note: This is probably my personal favorite of this list. As of this post the book is on pre-order, but I was fortunate enough to get a copy of the book that is made available to all employees, contractors, and visitors to Bridgewater Associates.</p>

<p>Right for you if…</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You enjoy the idea of running an team or organization that sugar coats nothing and where bullshitting is actively weeded out.</p></li>

<li><p>You’ve curious to understand the intimate psychology of a billionaire who started from humble beginnings.</p></li>

<li><p>You are a capable of, or at least open to, self-analyzing and self-evaluating yourself as objectively as possible.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>That’s it!</strong></p>

<p>This was a simpler blog post and I hope you get <em>something</em> out of at least one of the books I’ve listed.</p>
